May has been a very busy month. All our modules have had projects due so I haven't had
much time to work on personal things. Thankfully now the modules for this term are complete
and other than one more exam next week, we are now on holiday.

I have been able to work on a couple of things:


### [tick.js](http://github.com/AstromechZA/tick.js)
A tiny Javascript library for formatting Date objects and translating them between
time zones. The minimized size is only 2.6kB! I knew about Moment.js as I have used
it before and it is only 8kB, but I like writing my own libraries and learning so it
acts as an alternative rather than a replacement.


### [OctagonSave](http://github.com/AstromechZA/OctagonSave)
A Ruby gem for downloading songs from an 8tracks mix. I developed this out of
frustration with my internet connection and its inability to stream during peak times.
It works fairly well and adds ID3 tags to MP3's as well as downloading cover art.
It uses their v3 API throughout.


### Router traffic analysis
While attempting to work out why our internet connection was getting such high latency
and low bandwidth, I developed a Python program for logging traffic statistics from my Netgear
router and for pinging hosts. The results were then graphed using good ol' Highcharts.

### Project work
Last night I got some good work done on my part of the honours project: Octree mesh splitting.
To check that I am reading PLY files correctly I can render them as split-view blueprints:

Kinda fun!
