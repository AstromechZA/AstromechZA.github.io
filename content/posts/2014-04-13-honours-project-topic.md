This week my group received our project topic for our Honours thesis. The Computer Science faculty at my university (UCT) requires a thesis as part of the 4th year. This is done in groups so that the group collaborates on the code, but each group member writes their own thesis.

The topic we asked for and received is:

## Fast and accurate triangle mesh simplification for large heritage models.

Description:

> The Zamani project ([www.zamaniproject.org](http://www.zamaniproject.org)) at UCT uses laser scanning to capture huge 3D modelsof buildings and terrain for digital preservation and analysis. In order to reduce the size of themodels, they would like to simplify them, so that they retain important structural information while retaining their original appearance. There are two methods that will be utilised: simplification with normal maps, and feature preserving simplification. Normal maps approximate missing detail by means of shader-based techniques and can produce compelling results with low triangle counts. Feature-preserving approaches tend to reduce the number of triangles required to represent less complex regions, and only keep high detail where it is really required in the model. Once simplification is complete, the visual fidelity of the result must be assessed. This can be done by means of a visualisation front-end which shows the distribution or error caused by simplification. Various visual fidelity metrics can be used to quantify the simplification error too. A major challenge for simplification will be dealing with models that are very large and cannot fit into memory: this will require an 'out-of-core' solution.

The supervisor is Patrick Marais.

It looks like a lot of fun and should be a good challenge for my group. We are all familiar with 3D modeling since we all co-majored in Games Development.

So now our lectures start to take a back seat while we begin focussing on our solution.
